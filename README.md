# WalletFinder

## Description
The WalletFinder project consists of several Python scripts that work together to generate Bitcoin private keys, check their balances, and determine if a specific Bitcoin address has an associated balance. This allows users to generate a private key, derive the corresponding Bitcoin address, and check if the address holds any Bitcoin. The tools are simple yet effective for analyzing Bitcoin wallets based on private keys.

## Scripts
This project includes the following Python scripts:
1. **keygen.py**: Generates a random Bitcoin private key and saves it in a JSON file.
2. **balancechecker.py**: Converts a private key into a Bitcoin address to verify its balance.
3. **addressprivate.py**: Checks if a specified Bitcoin address holds a balance and analyzes it.

## How It Works
1. **keygen.py**:
    - Generates a random private key.
    - Derives the corresponding public address from the private key.
    - Saves the generated private key in a JSON file for later use.

2. **balancechecker.py**:
    - Takes the private key and uses it to derive the corresponding Bitcoin address.
    - Fetches the balance of the derived address from a blockchain API.
    - Displays the balance along with relevant transaction information.

3. **addressprivate.py**:
    - Accepts a Bitcoin address as input.
    - Checks the balance of the address using a blockchain API.
    - If the address holds a balance, it can identify the private key corresponding to that address.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install bitcoinlib requests
Run the key generation script:
CopyReplit
python keygen.py
To check the balance of a generated address, run:
CopyReplit
python balancechecker.py
To verify a specific address, run:
CopyReplit
python addressprivate.py
